# AWS Automation Scripts with CloudFormation, Shell Scripts, Userdata and More!

Welcome to my AWS Automation Scripts repository! Here you will find a collection of scripts that I have developed to automate various tasks on AWS, including CloudFormation templates, shell scripts, userdata and more.

## What's in the Repository?

The repository contains a variety of scripts that can be used for different purposes. Here's a brief overview of what you'll find:

- **CloudFormation Templates**: I have developed several CloudFormation templates that can be used to quickly deploy AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, RDS instances and more. These templates are written in YAML and are designed to be easy to read and modify.

- **Shell Scripts**: I have also developed a number of shell scripts that can be used to automate tasks on AWS. These scripts are written in Bash and can be run on Linux, macOS or Windows using Git Bash.

- **Userdata Scripts**: In addition to CloudFormation templates and shell scripts, I have also developed userdata scripts that can be used to configure EC2 instances when they are launched. These scripts can be used to install software, update configurations and perform other tasks.

- **Other Scripts**: Finally, the repository also contains a number of other scripts that I have developed for various purposes, such as automating backups, managing IAM roles and more.

## How to Use the Scripts?

To use the scripts in this repository, you will need to have an AWS account and the necessary permissions to create and manage resources. Once you have these, you can simply clone the repository to your local machine and start using the scripts.

Each script comes with a README file that provides detailed instructions on how to use it. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to open an issue on the repository and I'll be happy to help.
